# automatey, the ultimate time waster.

This is a repositary containing all the scripts I am using to supplement my [ComputerCraft](https://tweaked.cc/) addiction.

## Installation
The git.lua script provides a hacky way to fake a git clone of this repository. 
However, to use it one must first copy it onto the local machine. 
Fortunately, ComputerCraft provides a pastebin tool that can be used with the bin https://pastebin.com/tP7NRiix. 
In the root directory of the machine perform the following
```
pastebin get tP7NRiix git.lua
git
```
This will clone the repository into the ./automatey/ directory.
